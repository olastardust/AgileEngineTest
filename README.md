So far I can suggest only simple solutions for this task such as converting selected text to bold, italic, and underlined.
The part with synonyms requires a bit more knowledge that I have for now due to its communitation with Datamuse.

To run this webapp one should simply start index.html, enter any text in the editor, click twice on the word or simply select it.
Then pick the desirable button to format the selected text and voil√†. This also works vise versa which means one can select, for example, a bold text, click on "bold" button again, and the selected text will appear as a regular text.
